Threadneedle takes a new approach to Economic research, examining economic
structures as distributed systems and grounding them in network analysis and 
information theory. It is the first fully open-source 
software for simulating economies based on an accurate reproduction of the 
double entry book keeping transactions used by all modern banks.

Sciences such as Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science, have proceeded 
by detailed investigation and experimentation with the micro-structure of 
their fields to build up the considerable foundations on which they are 
currently based.  As there is as yet no theory for the 'atomic level" of 
economics, its methodology has taken a different path, 
and a number of economic phenomena and crises are left unexplained. 

We believe that developing detailed simulations of the economy, based on individual 
financial transactions and market based pricing, can begin to address the
current impasse in which (macro-)economics has found itself. Our approach is grounded
in the scientific method, and we welcome collaboration with people who share our vision of developing a 
basis for economic investigation based on the scientific method. If you want to contribute, please contact Dr. Jacky Mallett (jacky@iiim.is)


### Funding 

Threadneedle has been developed at the Icelandic Institute of Intelligent Machines on the initiative of its Principle Investigator Dr. Jacky Mallett, and the IIIM Director Dr. Kris Thorisson. Funding has been provided by an open grant from Rannis: The Icelandic Centre for Research.
